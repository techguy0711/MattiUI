# MattiUI
# MattiUI is in early beta, plese do not use in production just yet.

# What is MattiUI?
MattiUI is a Material UI library for SwiftUI. At MattiUI we write material design components using apple's own SwiftUI which means everything is just the right ammount of apple design and material design. Our goal is to bring Material design to SwiftUI without interupting the native feel of SwiftUI and apple's design styles.
